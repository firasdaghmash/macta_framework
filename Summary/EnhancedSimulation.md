🚀 Key Features Added:
1. Multiple Arrival Patterns

Poisson Distribution: Random arrivals (most common for business processes)
Normal Distribution: Predictable patterns with variance
Seasonal Patterns: End-of-month surges, holiday effects
Batch Processing: Grouped arrivals (like email processing)

2. Realistic Business Scenarios

Insurance Claims: 4.2 claims/hour with morning peaks and seasonal storms
Customer Service: Normal distribution with daily peak patterns
Order Processing: Batch processing with end-of-month surges

3. Advanced Queue Management

Queue length tracking over time
Priority-based case processing (Critical → High → Medium → Low)
Resource allocation and capacity constraints
Real-time bottleneck identification

4. Comprehensive Analytics

SLA Compliance Monitoring: Track cases meeting response time targets
Resource Utilization: Identify over/under-utilized resources
Capacity Planning: Determine optimal staffing levels
Peak Load Analysis: Understand system behavior under stress

5. Business Intelligence

Bottleneck Detection: Automatically identify system constraints
Smart Recommendations: Actionable suggestions for improvement
Cost-Benefit Analysis: ROI calculations for resource changes

📊 Business Impact Examples:
Before (Single Case): "This insurance claim takes 45 minutes"
After (Arrival Rate): "With 4.2 claims/hour arrival rate, your system will have 8-case queues during storm season, 23% SLA violations, and needs 2 additional adjusters to maintain 95% compliance"
🏗️ Integration with Your MACTA Structure:
This module fits perfectly in your /Modules/A/ folder (Analysis) and connects with:

M (Modeling): Uses your existing BPMN process models
C (Customization): Configurable for different industries
T (Training): Provides insights for process optimization training
A (Assessment): Delivers comprehensive performance metrics

🛠️ Installation Steps:

Place this file in /Modules/A/arrival_rate_simulation.php
Database: The existing schema supports this (uses simulation_results table)
Add to Navigation: Link from your main MACTA index page
Configure: Select business scenario and run simulations

🎯 Next Steps:
Would you like me to create:

Integration script to add this to your main MACTA navigation?
Database migration to add arrival rate specific tables?
API endpoints for external system integration?
Mobile-responsive dashboard for real-time monitoring?

This enhancement transforms your MACTA framework into a powerful capacity planning and optimization platform that can answer critical business questions like:

"How many staff do we need for holiday season?"
"What happens if case volume doubles?"
"Where should we invest in automation?"

Ready to revolutionize your process analysis capabilities! 🚀
